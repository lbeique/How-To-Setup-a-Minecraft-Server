## Download Mods on Curse Forge

1. Go to [www.curseforge.com/minecraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods) and download which mods you would like on your server. Make sure the mods you are downloading are compatible with your Forge software.

2. Create your "mods" folder in your .minecraft directory. To find .minecraft folder, go to your windows search box and enter "%appdata%". Your .minecraft folder should be near the top.

3. With the .minecraft folder open, right-click within File Explorer and select New followed by Folder on the pop-up menu. Name that folder “mods.”

    Note: If you can't find the AppData folder in your File Explorer, click View at the top of the window and make sure "Hidden Items" is checked.

4. Now, you can move the mod that you have downloaded from Curseforge into "mods" folder in your .minecraft directory. You can either copy and paste from your downloads folder or drag and drop into the mods folder.


5. Run your Minecraft game application and make sure you have selected the Forge account. This way your mods will load properly.
