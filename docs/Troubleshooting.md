| **Symptoms** | **Probable Cause** | **Action** |
| ------------ | ------------------ | ---------- |
| Unable to see folder. | Hidden view is disabled | If you can't find the AppData folder in your File Explorer, click View at the top of the folder window and make sure "Hidden Items" is checked. |
| Can't interact with the game near the player spawn. | There is a spawn protection setting on the server. | Go into the server.properties file and change the spawn-protection value from 16 to 0. |
| Can't connect to Game Services. | The Mojang Studio servers might be down. | Check the [Mojang Status Twitter](https://twitter.com/MojangStatus) to see if the servers are down. Otherwise, check your firewall and/or antivirus and make sure to allow the game's connection. |
