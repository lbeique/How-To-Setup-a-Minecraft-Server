## Getting started

### Prerequiste - Install Java

As a prerequisite to setting up the Minecraft server, we need to ensure that your computer can run and operate [Java](https://www.java.com/en/). 

1. Go to https://www.java.com/en/download/ and click on the Agree and Start Free Download button. Remember to keep track of where you download the file.

2. Locate the file you just downloaded, double click it and follow the installation wizard. Once you are done with this step, you will see the “You have successfully installed Java” message.

3. Next, we are going to download the Java Dev Kit. Go to https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk17-windows and click on the x64 installer download link. Make sure that the Windows tab is bolded, otherwise, the file downloaded will not work with Windows.

4. Once again, locate the file you downloaded, double click it and follow the installation wizard.

All done! Now we can begin setting up the Minecraft Server.
