# Introduction

On a public server players can collaborate with other plays to build more and play mini games. However, you cannot control exactly who can connect to the public servers. By setting up your own local server you can control exactly who can connect.

Setting up your own local server requires changing your home network's configuration and is not recommended unless you know what you are doing. If this is a concern for you, please see our alternative guide to set up a private server by purchasing Minecraft Realms. If you still want to go with this free route, please do so at your own risk!
